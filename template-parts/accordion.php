                            Prosthodontics is a formally recognised specialist branch of dentistry dedicated to the
                            design, manufacture, and fitting of artificial replacements for teeth and other parts of the
                            mouth. Common prosthodontic treatments include dentures, dental implants, crowns and
                            bridges. Once they have graduated from dental school, a prosthodontist receives three extra
                            years of training in their chosen field.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Prosthodontists are trained in the field of crown and bridgework, veneers, implant
                            reconstruction, denture work, occlusion, temporomandibular joint function and complex
                            full-mouth oral rehabilitation.

                            All dentists are trained in making crowns, bridges, and partial and complete dentures, so
                            why would you need to see a prosthodontist? Prosthodontists are experts in their field. With
                            an additional three years of training, they are much more equipped than your regular dentist
                            to replace anything in your mouth.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Prosthodontists have a specialised skill set to treat, plan, diagnose and manage intricate
                            dental problems. They frequently work in a multi-disciplinary environment with other
                            specialists and are skilled in biomaterials, biomechanics, function and aesthetics.

                            Patients are often referred to us by their general dental practitioner. A referral gives us
                            a much better understanding of your oral history and any problems you’ve had previously,
                            including how they were managed. Alongside your history, be sure to bring in any past
                            x-rays, exam results or other relevant material for your prosthodontist to discuss.
