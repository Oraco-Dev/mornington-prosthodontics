                        </div>
                        <p>Originally from the valleys of South Wales, UK, Dr David Laskey completed his Bachelor of
                            Dental Surgery from the University of Leeds, UK, in 2004. Upon graduation, David worked in
                            NHS and private practice before settling into private and referral practice in 2006,
                            focusing on dental implants and restorative dentistry. A passionate believer in postgraduate
                            education, Dr Laskey undertook several courses throughout Europe with leading clinicians and
                            gained his Diploma of Restorative Dental Practice (Distinction) from the prestigious
                            University College London, Eastman Dental Institute, and achieved a Master of Science (MSc)
                            in Endodontics.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            In 2012, Dr Laskey moved to the beautiful Mornington Peninsula, which he still calls home
                            today. He continued to pursue clinical excellence by undertaking further training in
                            Australia and overseas and has taught at both Sydney and Melbourne Dental Schools.
                            In 2019, Dr Laskey commenced his three-year full-time Doctor of Clinical Dentistry
                            (Prosthodontics) degree at the University of Melbourne. The focus of Dr Laskey’s thesis was
                            the comparison of digital and conventional workflows in aesthetic prosthodontic planning. He
                            has a keen interest in emerging digital technologies and recently co-authored his second
                            <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jerd.12949" target="_blank">scientific
                                publication</a>. Upon graduation, he was awarded the Straumann Group Award for
                            Academic Achievement for that year.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Although Dr Laskey is passionate about all aspects of prosthodontics, his special interests
                            are removable prosthodontics, fixed removable prosthodontics (conventional and
                            implant-based), and complex rehabilitations from single tooth to full mouth reconstructions.
                            As a respected member of several dental organisations, Dr Laskey has been invited as a guest
                            speaker to local dental events and is actively involved in the continuing education of young
                            dentists. Dr Laskey started Mornington Prosthodontics in 2022, bringing full-time
                            prosthodontic care to the heart of the Peninsula.
                            Dr Laskey is a Member of the International College of Prosthodontists (ICP), the Australian
                            Prosthodontic Society (APS), the Australasian Osseointegration Society (AOS), the
                            International Team of Implantology (ITI), the Royal Australian College of Dental Surgeons,
                            and the Australian Dental Association.
                            He is a committee member for the Australian Osteointegration Society (Victorian Branch) and
                            the Australian Prosthodontic Society Victorian Branch federal representative.
